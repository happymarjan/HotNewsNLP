# HotNewsNLP

This application is built with the purpose of recommending hot news to the users.

Please run the files with the following order:

- hotNews.py in order to download tweets. Incoming tweets are handled via streaming API.

- newsCorpusCleansing.py which handles cleaning and preparing the corpus. 

- clustering.py which performs feature selection and clustering on the input data.

Final result will be written in finalTweets.txt.

(The code is written in Python 3.)
